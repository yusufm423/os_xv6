# Real Time Scheduling Algorithms and Buffer Overflow attack in xv6 
1. Implementation of earliest deadline frst (EDF)
and rate monotonic (RM) scheduling algorithms to xv6 kernel code.
2. Wrote an exploit code which demonstrates a buffer overflow attack and implemented address space layout
randomization (ASLR) to mitigate this vulnerability.
